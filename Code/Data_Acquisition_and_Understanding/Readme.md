# This folder hosts code for data acquisition and understanding (exploratory analysis)

This folder contains 2 notebooks. One is for EDA on the competition dataset and the second is for explaining how do TFRecords work.
The one on the TFRecords show how to train a model from the TFRecords but as we progressed through our project, we no longer needed to deal with TFRecords.
