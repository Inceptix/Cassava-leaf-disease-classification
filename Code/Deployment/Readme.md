# This folder contains code for model deployment

The model that we used for deployment is in /Code/Modeling/Cassava_Production_Notebook.ipynb. 

We deployed this model on our dashboard for image classification and this model was saved by a checkpoint
when we run model.fit() in the last 5-Fold Cross Validation (after removing noisy labels).
